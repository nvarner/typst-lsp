//! Holds types relating to the LSP concept of a "workspace". That is, the directories a user has
//! open in their editor, the files in them, the files they're currently editing, and so on.
//!
//! # Terminology
//! - Package: anything that can be described by described by an `Option<PackageSpec>`, i.e. both
//!     external packages and current packages
//!     - External package: anything that can be described by a `PackageSpec`. A versioned package,
//!         likely downloaded, used as a dependency.
//!         - e.g. [`@preview/example:0.1.0`](https://github.com/typst/packages/tree/main/packages/preview/example-0.1.0)
//!     - Current package: something described by `None` as a value in `Option<PackageSpec>`. The
//!         set of files the user is actively working with, which should include a `main` source
//!         file.
//!         - e.g. a main resume source, template source, and some images
//!         - e.g. several chapter sources and a main source combining them
//!         - e.g. several main sources, each corresponding to one homework assignment for a course
//! - Project: a single current package together with a set of external packages
//!     - e.g. a current package with course notes and external packages for tables and commutative
//!         diagrams
//! - ProjectWorld: a project and a single main source picked from the current project
//!     - e.g. the latest homework assignment as main from several homework assignment sources
//!
//! # [`FileId`] interpretation
//! To interpret a `FileId`, we need to get a package from [`FileId::package`], then, within that
//! package, take the file at the path given by [`FileId::path`].
//!
//! To interpret `FileId::package` in general, we need a unique current package and a set of
//! external packages, which is a project. To interpret `FileId::path`, all we need is a package.
//! So, packages must be able to interpret paths, and projects must be able to interpret `FileId`s.
//!
//! We can represent an interpreted `FileId` by a URI, since a URI fully specifies a file. We can
//! also go backwards, representing a URI specifying a valid file as a `FileId` together with the
//! context needed to interpret it, which is a project.
